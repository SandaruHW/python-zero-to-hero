## Programming Language Types

There are two main types of programming languages:

### High-Level Languages
- **Easy for humans to read and write** - closer to natural language
- **Harder for computers to process** - requires translation/interpretation
- **Lower performance** - due to abstraction layers and translation overhead
- **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby
- **Benefits**: Faster development, easier debugging, better readability

### Low-Level Languages
- **Easy for computers to read and execute** - closer to machine code
- **Harder for humans to understand** - requires deep understanding of computer architecture
- **Higher performance** - direct hardware control with minimal overhead
- **Examples**: Assembly language, C
- **Benefits**: Maximum performance, precise hardware control, efficient memory usage
