## Programming Language Types

There are two main types of programming languages:

### High-Level Languages
- **Easy for humans to read and write** - closer to natural language
- **Harder for computers to process** - requires translation/interpretation
- **Lower performance** - due to abstraction layers and translation overhead
- **Examples**: Python, JavaScript, Java, Ruby
- **Benefits**: Faster development, easier debugging, better readability

### Low-Level Languages
- **Easy for computers to read and execute** - closer to machine code
- **Harder for humans to understand** - requires deep understanding of computer architecture
- **Higher performance** - direct hardware control with minimal overhead
- **Examples**: Assembly language, Machine code
- **Benefits**: Maximum performance, precise hardware control, efficient memory usage

## Project Structure

This Python learning journey is organized into different modules:

### 📚 Learning Modules

1. **hello_world/** - Getting started with Python basics
   - `demo.py` - First Python program and basic syntax

2. **data_types/** - Understanding Python data types
   - `demo.py` - Examples of different data types (strings, numbers, lists, etc.)

3. **variable_and_operators/** - Variables and operators in Python
   - `demo.py` - Variable assignment and mathematical/logical operators

### 🚀 How to Run

Navigate to any module directory and run the demo file:

```bash
cd hello_world
python demo.py
```

```bash
cd data_types
python demo.py
```

```bash
cd variable_and_operators
python demo.py
```
